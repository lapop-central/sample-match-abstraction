sample-matched survey project

* This project is a module to facilitate sample matching for survey
  projects
* It assumes it sits in a folder at the root of a larger project
  directory, and has access to "raw", a data directory
  * doc and out directories are contained within the submodule
* matching_process.* provides a flowchart for the current process
  (currently in dire need of updating)
